# SICODER

**SICODER** is a system-built identity layer for focused digital work.

It is not a portfolio.  
It is not a personal brand.

SICODER exists to initialize context and route interaction.

---

## What SICODER Is

SICODER functions as a **base layer system**.

Everything else runs on top of it.

- No storytelling
- No persuasion
- No mixed audiences

Only system state and context selection.

---

## Core Purpose

Different audiences require different surfaces.

SICODER separates those surfaces at the entry point.

Instead of blending identities, it routes them.

---

## Structure

SICODER contains:

- **Initialization Layer**  
  Establishes system state and readiness.

- **Context Router**  
  Allows users to choose how they want to engage.

- **System Footer**  
  Displays metadata and system status.

## Available Contexts

### SYIFA F.A
Professional context.

- Structured
- Recruiter-friendly
- Clear documentation
- Team and client ready

### KAI SHI
Experimental context.

- Raw execution
- Technical exploration
- Unfiltered learning space
- Builder-first environment

---

## Design Principles

- Context before content
- Identity as a module
- Minimal surface, maximum signal
- No unnecessary decoration
- Clear separation of intent

---

## Visual System

Color palette is intentionally limited:

- **Red** — system signal and active state
- **Black** — focus and execution
- **White** — clarity and structure

These colors scale across contexts without rebranding.

---

## Interaction Rules

- Hover indicates state, not decoration
- Transitions are short and predictable
- Motion confirms action, never distracts

---

## Technical Notes

- No framework dependency
- No build tools
- Lightweight and portable
- Designed for long-term stability

The base layer should remain simple and durable.

---

## Philosophy

SICODER does not try to impress.

It tries to be correct.
